Please go to the website

and create an account, after creating an account click on the dashboard, located in the top right of the screen. You can click your account and it should take you to a screen where it gives you an API key. Please copy that key and save it, it will be funcitonal for 24 hours. If this doesnt work please email me, and I will send you a new key to use when running the code.
